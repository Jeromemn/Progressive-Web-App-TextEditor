## Description
This project is a Progressive Web Application that recognized JavaScript and can be typed in and saved both via a live web application and a local application that is off line. The online and offline versions will sync together to ensure nothing is lost.For this Project webpack was used to create a service worker to get static assets pre cache as well as webpack pluggins such as "HtmlWebpackPlugin", "InjectManifest" and "WebpackPwaManifest". Webpack bundles the files and creates a HTML file, serviceworker.js file and a maifest.json file inside a newly created dist folder. Another package used was idb to store data. The online application allows the user to download the Jate file and use the application offline both in that local app and in the browser, both of which will update when reconnected to internet.
